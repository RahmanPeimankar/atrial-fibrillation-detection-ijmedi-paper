In order to use run the Jyputer notebooks, you should first download the below four databases from PhysioNet website (https://physionet.org/). Then, put them a folder named "data" in the same path of the notebooks files.

* MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (https://physionet.org/content/afdb/1.0.0/) 
* MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
* Long Term AF Database (https://physionet.org/content/ltafdb/1.0.0/)
* MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/)

By executing the "main.ipynb" file, you can reproduce the results presented in the manuscript.
